## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Git clone this repo**

    ```shell
    git clone ...
    ```

1.  **Add your GitHub PAT to `config.js`.**

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd portfolio/
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

## 📝 Notes

By Default it will only show repositories with [Social Previews](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview) set. You can change this if you want in `src/components/repos.js`
